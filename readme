# ! Do This Firstly

copy executables of structure preparation (from RELEASE_CppPolygons):
    mc_binary for [local/remote]_task_consecutive_binary_mc
    mc_ternary for [local/remote]_task_consecutive_ternary_mc
to ./structure

copy private_settings.py to .


# Better version of fem tasks runner

consecutive - disks number increases starting from 1 until consecutive
