# ! Do This Firstly

copy executables of structure preparation:
    mc_binary for [local/remote]_task_consecutive_binary_mc
    mc_ternary for [local/remote]_task_consecutive_ternary_mc

# Better version of fem tasks runner

consecutive - disks number increases starting from 1 until consecutive
    fails happen. ar, tau, Lr are fixed.

terbary - the system is ternary
binary - the system  is binary

mc - Monte-Carlo algorithm of its formation is used.

task_consecutive_ternary_mc - the same for binary system


# Executables are taken from RELEASE_CppPolygons

[local/remote]_task_consecutive_[binary/ternary]_mc
